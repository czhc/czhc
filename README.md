### Getting Started

Check out the pinned repositories for projects I'm actively working on. 
I also recommend checking out the collection of AWS workshops I have conducted and documented.

* [Serverles Analytics](https://github.com/czhc/serverless-datalake-on-aws)

or how I go about studying different tools like: [artillery](https://github.com/czhc/artillery), [swift](https://github.com/czhc/FizzBuzz), [sails-js (Node)](https://github.com/czhc/demo-sails), [padrino (Ruby)](https://github.com/czhc/padrino-exp) and [solidity](https://github.com/czhc/solidity-intro)
